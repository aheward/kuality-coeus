Feature: Submitting Proposals via s2s to Grants.gov

  As a researcher, I want the ability to submit my completed proposals
  through to grants.gov

  Background: Logged in with a proposal creator; have other necessary user
    Given a user exists with the system role: 'Proposal Creator'
    And   a user exists that can be a PI for Grants.gov proposals
    And   an AOR user exists
    And   I log in with the Proposal Creator user
  @test
  Scenario Outline: Submit a proposal to Grants.gov with various sponsors and opportunities
    Given I initiate a proposal with <Sponsor> as the sponsor
    And   add the <Provider> opportunity id of <Opportunity> to the proposal
    And   add the <Provider> user as the proposal's PI
    And   set valid credit splits for the proposal
    And   add and mark complete all the required attachments
    And   create, finalize, and mark complete a budget version for the proposal
    And   complete the required custom fields on the proposal
    And   answer the S2S questions
    And   submit the proposal
    When  I log in with the AOR user
    And   submit the proposal to S2S
    Then  the S2S tab's submission details will say the proposal is submitted
    And   within a couple minutes the submission status will be updated
