# Note the difference between the following three
# step definitions...

# This step definition is a bit dangerous
# 1) Assumes that the user already exists in the system
# 2) Assumes the user object does not exist, so it creates it, sticking it into
#    a class instance variable based on the username
# 3) Logs that user in (if they're not already)...
Given /^I'm logged in with (.*)$/ do |username|
  make_user(user: username).sign_in

# Whereas, this step def
# 1) Assumes the user OBJECT already exists
# 2) Assumes the user object is contained in a class instance variable
#    based on the role
# 3) Assumes that role user already exists in the system
# 4) Logs that user in, if they're not already
Given /^I? ?log in with the (.*) user$/ do |role|
  get(role).sign_in

# This step definition
# 1) Creates the user object in a class instance variable based on the user name
# 2) Creates the user in the system if they don't exist already,
#    by first logging in with the admin user
Given /^a user exists with the user name (.*)$/ do |username|
  user = make_user user: username
  user.create unless user.exists?
end

# This step definition will return a user with
# the specified role. If there are multiple matching
# users, it will select one of them randomly, and create
# them if they don't exist in the system (again by first
# logging in with the admin user to do the creation).
Given /^a user exists with the system role: '(.*)'$/ do |role|
  user = make_user role: role
  user.create unless user.exists?
end

# Use this step definition immediately after a step where you
# have made/created a user. They'll be last in the collection.
