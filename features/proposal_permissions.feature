Feature: Permissions in a Proposal

  As a researcher, I want to be able to assign others permissions to a proposal,
  to allow them to work on the proposal with me, and to control what actions
  they are capable of performing with it.

  Background: A user has started a proposal
    Given   I'm logged in with admin

  Scenario: The proposal initiator is automatically an aggregator
    Given   I initiate a proposal
    When    I visit the proposal's Permissions page
    Then    admin is listed as an Aggregator for the proposal
  @test
  Scenario Outline: Adding various roles to proposals
    Given   I have a user with the user name kctestuser7
    And     I initiate a proposal
    When    I assign kctestuser7 as a <Role> to the proposal permissions
    Then    kctestuser7 can access the proposal
    And     their proposal permissions allow them to <Permissions>

    Examples:
    | Role             | Permissions                                    |
#    | Narrative Writer | only update the Abstracts and Attachments page |
    | Aggregator       | edit all parts of the proposal                 |
#    | Budget Creator   | only update the budget                         |
#    | Deleter          | delete the proposal                            |
#    | Viewer           | only read the proposal                         |

  Scenario: Error when Aggregator role is designated among others
    Given I initiate a proposal
    And   I assign kctestuser10 as an aggregator to the proposal permissions


  Scenario: User with Proposal permission sees proposal in their action list
    Given I'm logged in with admin
    And   I have a user with a role of 'OSPApprover'
    And   I initiate a proposal
    And   I complete the proposal
    When  I submit the proposal
    Then  the proposal is in OSPApprover's action list
